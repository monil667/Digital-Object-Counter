# Working Principle
- **Object Detection**: When an object passes through the sensor, it interrupts the light beam, causing a change in the sensor's output signal.
- **Monostable MV**: It generates trigger pulses, output of this it fed into Astable MV Reset signal
- **Astable MV**: It generates Square wave work as Clock signal for Counter IC
- **Counter**: Which registers each signal as a count pulse.
- **Display Update**: The counter IC processes the pulses and updates the 7-segment display to show the current count.

# Applications
- *Educational Projects*: Helps students understand the basics of electronics and digital counting.
- *Small-Scale Industries*: Useful for simple counting tasks such as tallying products on a conveyor belt.also for counting the number of peoples in certain area

# Benefits
- **Cost-Effective:** Utilizes basic and inexpensive components, making it affordable to build.
- **Educational Value:** Provides hands-on experience with fundamental electronic concepts and components.
- **Simplicity:** Easy to assemble and understand, making it suitable for beginners in electronics.
- **Customizability:** Can be modified and expanded to include additional features such as multiple digit displays or wireless data transmission.

# Conclusion
Digital Object Counter using a basic electronic circuit is a practical and educational device that leverages essential electronic components to achieve accurate object counting. Its simplicity, affordability, and ease of use make it an excellent tool for learning and small-scale applications.
